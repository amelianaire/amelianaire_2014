                <p>Our site has many user types, but the homepage content is geared specifically towards consumers new to the brand.</p>
                <h2>User's Goal</h2>
                <p>Within a few seconds, determine whether or not this website has something the user needs.</p>
                <h2>Business Goal</h2>
                <p>Improve lead generation plus time on site, and create a more visually appealing homepage fitting for a luxury travel site.</p>

                <li>Focus on content and tell a story.</li>
                <li>Design the page around one very clear path: connecting consumers to a travel advisor.</li>
                <li>Provide a primary path for new users which succinctly lays out the process and key benefits of working with an advisor. A secondary "browse advisors" CTA offers a shortcut to select an advisor.</li>
                <li>Promote real user stories to give an authentic, first-person perspective.</li>
                <li>Weave the value of the travel advisor throughout the layout while keeping the focus on what the consumer gets.</li></ul>

                <li>Image of travel advisors feels stock. Group images are harder less engaging.</li>
                <li>Layout relies on the user clicking images and lacks clear button CTAs. User is unclear where to go.</li></ul>

                <li>Decreased bounce rate by 13% for new users and 7% for returning users.</li>
