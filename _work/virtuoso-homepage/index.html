                <h2>User</h2>
                <p>Our site has many user types, but the homepage content is geared specifically towards consumers new to the brand.</p>
                <h2>User's Goal</h2>
                <p>Within a few seconds, determine whether or not this website has something the user needs.</p>
                <h2>Business Goal</h2>
                <p>Improve lead generation plus time on site, and create a more visually appealing homepage fitting for a luxury travel site.</p>
               
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <ul class="content ul bullets">
                <li>Focus on content and tell a story.</li>
