                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>While my clients wanted to play off their Valentine's weekend wedding, they didn't want to be too clich&eacute;. The bride asked if I could create an invitation using a heart balloon "without making it cheesy." Integrating the balloon string into the type gave real purpose to the illustration, and led to a bright, fun invite that was perfect for their big day.</p>
