                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                <p>Bless Me, Ultima is a coming-of-age story about a teenage boy, Antonio, and his spiritual guide, Ultima. Ultima's owl is a key character in the book, and served as inspiration for our campaign.</p>
                <p>In my design, the shape of the owl was pulled from illustrations on old Mexican pottery. To create an immediate sense of place, I used Southwestern textiles to fill in the owl.</p>
                <p>In addition to traditional newspaper ads and posters, we created stencils and applied spray chalk ads for the campaign across the city to pique interest and gain momentum.</p>
