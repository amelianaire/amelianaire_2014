                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Since consumers were the majority of our mobile traffic, we scrapped our B2B mobile site (which had been built years before by a lone developer) and set out to build an effective experience for consumers. A side project from our sprint work, we kept the focus very small to ensure we could deliver the most important consumer content with our limited resources (three UX designers and one developer). As a bonus, we used the opportunity to introduce new styles which would later be integrated to desktop. While it was a highly collaborative effort, I focused on the cruise and "Find an Advisor" flows.</p>

                <li>Completely redesign look and feel to elevate the brand and match our luxury offerings.</li>
                <li>Test user flows throughout the 9-month process and integrate feedback.</li>
