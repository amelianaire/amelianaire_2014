                <h2>Project Details:</h2> 
                <p>Although Texas has a top ten engineering program, misconceptions about Texas sometimes keep students from the East and West coasts from considering UT Austin. After analyzing user profiles and uncovering these deterrents, we sent targeted emails to top prospective students to concisely sell UT Austin.</p>
                <p>The clear call-to-action leads to a newly-built <a href="http://www.engr.utexas.edu/graduate/why">webpage</a> with updated, easy-to-skim content to convince the student to apply.</p>
                <p>In the first year of this campaign, we saw an increase in the overall number of applications, as well as dozens of applicants who, based on our data, would otherwise not have considered Texas Engineering.</p>
