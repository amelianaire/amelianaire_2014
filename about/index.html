                <p>I’m a detail-oriented designer with six years of experience crafting online experiences. Currently I'm a UX designer at Virtuoso, a travel company.</p> 
                
                <p>I follow the user-centered design process. I love defining the problem, establishing goals, researching, iterating, gathering feedback and collaborating. My favorite projects are those where I find ways to translate complex business rules into understandable UI. I believe the web should be accessible to all.</p>
                
                <p>Aside from design, I have experience in writing for web, prototyping in HTML and CSS, and a knack for articulating points
                    
                    
                    best practices of web writing,  experience with writing effective web copy, following usability and accessibility best practices I've been on small, &ldquo;we-do-it-all&rdquo; teams where I picked up new skills from collaborating with my colleagues how to write web copy, effective marketing strategy, and even creating multimedia content.</p>
                
                <p>As my interest in web grew and quickly became my most challenging and fun work, I began to focus on user-centered design principles, and quickly realized there was more problem-solving in UI design than in a typical marketing campaign or piece of collateral. </p>
