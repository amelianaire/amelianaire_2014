                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been crafting effective, user-centered designs for 13 years. Currently, I&rsquo;m a Lead Product Designer at Expedia focused on scalable solutions for shared customer problems.</p>
                    <p>I know how to solve the root problem using qualitative and quantitative insights while balancing business goals and technical trade-offs. I excel in considering problems holistically, managing expectations and resources across teams, and delivering intuitive solutions to users. </p>
                    <p>I love collaborating across disciplines and believe we deliver our best work when everyone&rsquo;s ideas are heard. </p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I spend time traveling with my family, baking, and practicing classical voice.
